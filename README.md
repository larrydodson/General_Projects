## Overview 
  
  What is a Food Desert? - The USDA defines living in a food desert as living more than one mile from a supermarket in urban/suburban areas, and more than 10 miles from a supermarket in rural areas. These are areas of limited access to healthy, nutritious and affordable food. Food Deserts are also categorized by population density, the level of access to transportation, and income levels of the populations in these areas. The information that would be available by identifying Food Desert locations can help people mitigate access to healthy, lower cost food for their communities. 
   

   ### Purpose
   To apply machine learning and neural networks, and using the features within the provided dataset, create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting locations that are potentially Food Deserts.  
   
   
   The deliverables are: 
   - Deliverable 1: Presentation
   - Deliverable 2: GitHub
   - Deliverable 3: Machine Learning Model
   - Deliverable 4: Database

   ### Deliverable 3: Machine Learning Model
   
   * Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database   LD

##### Outputs labels for input data

1. Target/Output variable = 

    **LILATracts_1And10**

          Low income and low access tract measured at 1 mile for urban areas and 10 miles for rural areas	
                          
2. Feature variables =
    1. lasnaphalf
          
    2. lasnapshare
    3. lahunvhalf
    4. lahunvshare
    5. lasnap1

   .
   
   
   ### Deliverable 4: Database
   
   * Present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following:
      - Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema   LD
      - Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database    LD
