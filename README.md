## Overview 
  
  What is a Food Desert? - The USDA defines living in a food desert as living more than one mile from a supermarket in urban/suburban areas, and more than 10 miles from a supermarket in rural areas. These are areas of limited access to healthy, nutritious and affordable food. Food Deserts are also categorized by population density, the level of access to transportation, and income levels of the populations in these areas. The information that would be available by identifying Food Desert locations can help people mitigate access to healthy, lower cost food for their communities. 
   

   ### Purpose
   To apply machine learning and neural networks, and using the features within the provided dataset, create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting locations that are potentially Food Deserts.  
   
   
   The deliverables are: 
   - Deliverable 1: Presentation
   - Deliverable 2: GitHub
   - Deliverable 3: Machine Learning Model
   - Deliverable 4: Database

## Results

   * For working code and python program, please see: `Food_Deserts_Module20.ipynb`


   ### Deliverable 1: Presentation
   
   * Selected topic:  Food Deserts in the Austin, Texas Metro Area.
  
   * Reason why this topic was selected: Vertical farming and urban farming are becoming more prescient topics as climate change and increased urbanization of population occcurs.  Timely and accurate understanding of what locations can be considered "food deserts" can aid urban planning to preempt possible, or increasing, food scarcity in heavily urbanized locations.  This understanding can assist in increasing life-span, quality of life and resource allocation for future generations.
  
   * Description of the source data: The data was retrieved from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/tcrammond/food-access-and-food-deserts).  The data comes from the United States Department of Agriculture on census-tract level data on access to supermarkets.
  
   * Questions hoping to answer with the data:  OR
   
   1. What geographic areas in the Austin, Texas metro area are defined as "Food Deserts"? 
   
   2. abc    

  
   .
  
   
   ### Deliverable 2: GitHub  
   
   * READ.me established - complete 
   * Description of the communication protocols   OR
   * Individual Branches established, and each team member with min of four commits - Complete 
   
   
   . 
   
   
   ### Deliverable 3: Machine Learning Model
   
   * Present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following:
      - Takes in data in from the provisional database - Complete
